The global community requires an open source alternative to the gig economy. Here lies a permanent link to this public good; Rostr.

This repository hosts a FOSS instantiation of a gig working application built on Nostr. It is aimed to free service providers, and customers from the shackles of opaque algorithms of present-day gig economy. Users can post messages of services required via relays to a public roster. Those subscribed to the roster can then read those relays. This can be done both to list services or avail listed services.

Any gig service can be listed and sought after through relays on Rostr https://cdis.iitk.ac.in/rostr/

We invite developers to create forks of this project with better trust mechanisms, language support, UI improvements etc. It is our hope to motivate a FOSS-driven competitor within the gig-economy.
